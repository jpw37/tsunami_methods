# tsunami_methods
Methods for analyzing and visualizing statistical posterior distribution for Bayesian construction of historical earthquakes and tsunamis.

This repo contains the data for the constructed posterior distribution of the 1820 Sulawesi and 1852 Banda Sea earthquake based on historical accounts of the resultant tsunami.  The inversion process was carried out using a Bayesian reconstruction, relying on the Geoclaw software package as described in detail in Ringer et al 2021 and Paskett et al 2024.
